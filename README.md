 ## Project organization
 In my repository, i have included a folder for the data, a folder for the figures, and left my individual reports loose. The data folder includes the original zip file that contains the original data table, as well as my edited data table. The edited data table just changes the names of columns to ensure no spaces or hyphens are present, and does the same for the file title. The figures represent the exports of figures found within each code and are labeled with the corresponding question of mine they aim to represent.

## About the analysis

### Overall, I answer three questions in this analysis: 

Question 1: This paper finds triple-negative breast cancers have a tendency toward a posterior or prepectoral location; they also note an association between mammographic density and posterior location. If looking at just the "middle" data along the anterior-posterior axis, how does the median mammographic density vary by tumor subtype?

Question 2: The paper focuses on relationship between location and tumor subtype. Does this change or become more pronounced when looking exclusively at the largest and smallest extremes (top and bottom 10%, respectively) of tumor size within each tumor subtype?

Question 3: Histologic grade and posterior location were also found to be positively correlated. What is the average histologic grade of the top 25% most posteriorly-located tumors, regardless of subtype?

Analysis and answers for questions 1 and 2 can be found in my Python report, while analysis and answer for question 3 can be found in my R report.
